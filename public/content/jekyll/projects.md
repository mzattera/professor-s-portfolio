# Research Projects

## Current Projects

### Interpretable AI for Healthcare Decision Support
*Funded by NIH (2023-2027)*

Developing AI systems that can explain their reasoning in medical diagnosis contexts. Our goal is to create tools that augment physician decision-making while maintaining transparency and accountability.

**Key Collaborators**: Dr. Sarah Chen (Stanford Medicine), Dr. Michael Lee (UCSF)

---

### Multilingual Language Understanding
*Funded by NSF (2022-2025)*

Building language models that can effectively understand and generate text across multiple languages, with a focus on low-resource languages that are often underrepresented in AI research.

**Key Collaborators**: Dr. Ana Rodriguez (MIT), Dr. Yuki Tanaka (University of Tokyo)

---

### Human-AI Collaborative Writing
*Funded by Google Research (2023-2024)*

Investigating how AI writing assistants can best support human creativity without replacing human agency. This project explores the design space of collaborative writing tools.

**Graduate Students**: James Park, Emily Watson
