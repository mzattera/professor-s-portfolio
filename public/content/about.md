## About Me

I am a Professor of Computer Science at Stanford University, where I have been a faculty member since 2012. My research focuses on the intersection of artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, and computational linguistics.

Prior to joining Stanford, I completed my Ph.D. at MIT under the supervision of Prof. James Henderson, where I developed novel approaches to natural language understanding. I also spent two years as a postdoctoral researcher at Carnegie Mellon University.

## Research Interests

- **Natural Language Processing**: Developing more intuitive and accurate language models
- **Human-AI Collaboration**: Designing systems that augment human capabilities
- **Computational Linguistics**: Understanding the structure and meaning of human language
- **Machine Learning Ethics**: Ensuring AI systems are fair, transparent, and accountable

## Education

- **Ph.D. in Computer Science**, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2010
- **M.S. in Computer Science**, University of California, Berkeley, 2006
- **B.S. in Mathematics and Computer Science**, Princeton University, 2004
